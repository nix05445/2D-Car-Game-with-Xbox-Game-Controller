I created a 2D car game where the user continuously tries to drive around oncoming potholes to avoid damaging their car. Users may select from 4 cars to drive.
The game requires the user to connect an Xbox game controller to their computer. Mapping controller buttons to the code was possible by using Gamepad API and 
creating the game itself was possible by using p5.js.
